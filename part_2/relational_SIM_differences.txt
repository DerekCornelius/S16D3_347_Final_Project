SIM
	- no need for logical, relational models
	- no foreign keys, primary keys
	- need to explicitly declare relationships between rows(entities)
	- when you create an instance of a subclass it automatically creates instance of superclass(no need for ddl4 in relational)


Relational
	- not as intuitive as object oriented nature of SIM (you need logical and relational models)
	- all classes need a primary key and relationship are defined implicitly with foreign keys
	- you need triggers(ddl4) to insert instance of superclass when creating subclass
